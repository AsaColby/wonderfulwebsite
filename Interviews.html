                <h5> <i>Interviews! </i></h5>
                <p>Quick note on these interviews: These were for the original idea of a phone lock box for studying.

                <h5> Interviewee 1 </h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify"> Interviewee 1 is a young individual with a standard upbringing in this digital age. They got their first phone in 6th grade for safety and communication with their parents due to their school‚Äôs distance. Initially, the phone was used for games and music, but in high school, it evolved into a tool for interaction with peers. The shift increased their phone use significantly, creating a burden rather than a convenience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Interviewee 1 describes themselves as <i>addicted to their phone</i>, defining addiction as the reflexive need to check it, even without a specific purpose. They spend 7-8 hours daily on their phone, texting, gaming, and listening to music. They enjoy the connection texting provides and acknowledges that some of it comes from obligation not genuine enjoyment. Their phone usage has mixed impacts on their relationships, at times enhancing interactions but often pulling them away from present moments. Efforts to limit their usage, such as physically distancing themselves from the phone, have had little success.

                <p style="text-align:justify"> Interviewee 1 reflects on societal implications of phone addiction, especially among students. They perceive phones as major distractions in academic settings, often leading to autopilot scrolling on apps like Instagram. However, they also appreciate the potential of creative solutions that blend physical and digital barriers to mitigate overuse. Their ideal intervention would incorporate friction, such as requiring a physical action to unlock their phone.
<br><br><br>

                <h5> Interviewee 2 </h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify"> Interviewee 3 is a professor in their mid-thirties to early fifties who has witnessed the evolution of mobile technology firsthand. They grew up without the pervasive presence of smartphones, which gives them a unique perspective on mobile device addiction. Their use of technology begun with a focus on practicality, such as checking email s or helping their children. However, over time, they have recognized patterns of overuse, particularly in the context of academic environments and personal routines.
                <br>
                <br>
                The professor acknowledges their own phone addiction, defining it as a lack of control over their usage and a reflexive tendency to check the device. They typically spend 1.5 to 2 hours daily on their phone, allocated to emails, puzzles, and occasional social interactions. They value functional use but recognized that some scrolling and gaming habits are unnecessary. They are particularly interested in societal and educational implications of phone addiction and advocate for structural solutions rather than solely individual responsibility.

                <h6 style="text-align: left"> Insights </h6>
                <p style="text-align:justify"> The professor views phone addiction as a public health issue requiring systemic interventions, such as laws, norms, and school policies. They are intriguued by innovative solutions like ‚ÄúYonder‚Äù phone locks for classrooms, which maintain functional use while eliminating addictive features. Personal strategies, like evening phone-free routines, have helped but are insufficient without broader cultural shifts. They emphasize the need for creative approaches that combine functionality with intentional friction to promote mindful usage.

                <h5> Interviewee 3 </h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify"> Interviewee 3 is an individual with moderate phone usage habits, spending approximately 3‚Äì4 hours daily on their device. Their primary activities include messaging apps like Instagram, WeChat, and standard messaging services, as well as scrolling social media. While they find their phone useful for productivity and relaxation, they express frustration with occasional overuse and the difficulty in maintaining focus on academic or personal tasks. They do not consider themselves addicted to their phone, defining addiction as the inability to stop using the device despite other priorities.
                <br><br>
                While their parents didn‚Äôt impose strict restrictions, they instilled trust in their childs self-discipline, which shaped their current relationship with technology. Interviewee 3 values balance, setting goals for daily tasks and incorporating short breaks for relaxation. They also explore positive reinforcement strategies, like rewarding themselves for limiting screen time, and use apps like Flora to monitor and control usage.

                <p style="text-align:justify"> Interviewee 3 highlights the importance of self-discipline and intentionality when using technology. They believe entertainment apps can be a healthy part of life if approached with clear goals. Their use of the Flora app shows how gamifying self-control can improve habits and foster a sense of achievement. They advocate for better awareness of personal goals and rewards to motivate individuals to balance phone usage effectively.
<br><br><br>

                <h5> Interviewee 4 </h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify"> Interviewee 4 grew up with strict parental restrictions on technology use, which paradoxically fueled an increased reliance on phones and other devices as they gained independence. Over time, they came to view their phone as both a tool for productivity and a source of distraction. They acknowledge an addiction to screens but considers this addiction normalized due to its prevalence in modern society.

                <br><br>
                They observe that overusage of their phone has negatively impacted their academic focus and, to a lesser extent, their personal relationships. However, they also see value in approaching technology with intent while maintaining a balance between relaxation and productivity. They are comfortable with their current habits but recognizes a potential need to reassess their relationship with screens in the future.

They value technology's utility but emphasizes the importance of intentionality and boundaries. Ruby‚Äôs perspective on the normalization of phone addiction highlights a broader societal issue, emphasizing the need for collective awareness and innovative approaches to manage screen time effectively.
