                <p class="lead">3D Printing Tests</p>
                <p>I regretfully do not have a picture of my first ever print, which was the nametag; imagine a nametag that is white on the bottom and bright green on the top saying "Asa Colby Weinstein". That is basically it. I needed to download PrusaSlicer and I learned a lot about the 3D printers! I thought that the precise nature of these printers in specific, where they account for the shaking of the tables up to like 4 derivatives was very interesting. This print went well! No problems!

                <p style= "font-size: 103%";> Torture Test 1 (fail)</p>
                <p>I regret to inform that after waiting 40 minutes for my print to fail... it did not. I found this torture test on thingiverse and was excited to push the printer to it's limits but was dissapointed to see it was just too good! I think the biggest problem was that I made it too small, but then I imagine I make it bigger and that just reinforces the structure more. I think I definetly need to learn and test out more of the limits of the printers. Very cool shape though! I really like how it turned out (even if it wasn't supposed to).

                <img src="./assets/test2.jpg" width="300" height="400">
                <p style= "font-size: 103%";> Torture Test 2 (better!)</p>
                <p> This torture test went better! As you can see below some areas where the filament drooped down. I got this also from a thingiverse file, but it was one in a series of torture tests all on the same board; imagine one board with 10 different smaller tests on it. It would have taken forever to print! Not only that, but a lot of them seemed very possible for the printer, because of this I cut out only one of the tests on the board. I made it much bigger but was still scared that it would work, the TA (Penny) gave the suggestion of stretching it out to make the step-off larger. This worked and give very slight deformations to the print!
