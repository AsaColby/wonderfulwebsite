                <h5> <i>Design Review! </i></h5>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Over the course of this project, our prototype changed a lot. We began with the final product being a box to put your phone in to study, then shifted to a smaller box that can act as a phone case, then back to a stationary box. The focus of the initial prototype was for the use-cases of studying and general time. Through our feedback that we received in that initial design, and pushing from the professor, we shifted our focus of the problem towards a more specific vision, focusing on phone use in the mornings rather than phone use in general.

                <br>
                <br>

                <p> Along with this change, we also had to shift our How Might We statements, which were: 
                <p style="text-align:left">
                    (1) How might we address people‚Äôs reflex of automatically reaching for their phone/pursuing addictive media
                    <br>
                    (2) How might we make it easier to stop using one‚Äôs phone once finished with a task?
                    <br>
                    (3) How might we create more awareness over when strategies stop working
                    <br>
                    (4) How might we make phones less distracting for the user?

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Over the redesign, we shifted the scope of the problem to a more specific area and changed <br>our How Might We statements basically completely. 
                <p style="text-align:left">
                    (1) How might we address people‚Äôs reflex of automatically reaching for their phone in the morning
                    <br>
                    (2) How might we make sure that unhealthy phone use doesn‚Äôt happen right after waking up

                <br>
                <br>

                <p>Returning to brainstorming after shifting the How Might We statements, we came up with our current design.
                <br>

                <p style="text-align:justify">So we decided to design a box which locks when the user's alarm is set off in the morning to prevent phone usage after waking up. The problem then is how does it know when to unlock? Thinking about the actions we do in the morning, we came up with the threshold of getting up and brushing your teeth! This would make sure that the user is not using their phone until they are fully ‚Äúawake‚Äù. The way that we would allow the box to be unlocked would be through the of a toothbrush attached to a weight sensor. Once the toothbrush is picked up, a two minute timer would be set, and at the end of that timer the box will automatically unlock. 

                <br>

                <p>The 
                <a href="https://www.example.com">
                  initial feedback
                <a/>
                  from the original idea was okay, the group that we interviewed was somewhat judgemental and questioning the idea. After we shifted, <br> there were more positive responses from the feedback. 
<br><br>
                <p>The feedback showed that they liked:
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                        <br>
                    (1) The idea
                                        <br>
                    (2) That the lock box was for extended period of time
                                        <br>
                    (3) That it addressed a problem that they have
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <P> They also gave constructive feedback through a more personal lens:
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                        (1) Some people have morning phone time as a part of their morning routine - wanted some level of customization
                        <br>
                        (2) Some believed that they would be frustrated and just bypass by breaking the box
                        <br>
                        (3)Some felt that they didn‚Äôt really want to sleep with a box in their bed
<br><br>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">Overall, users liked the idea! They liked that it removed the element of choice in the morning. The constructive feedback overall focused on the conflict between the product‚Äôs function and an individual's personal habits. For instance, one person said that they always wake up before the alarm. They don‚Äôt even need an external barrier to prevent themselves from using the phone. So, we came to the conclusion that they weren‚Äôt in our target audience. Some other interviewees believe that they schedule their phone using time before ‚Äòtoothbrushing‚Äô in their morning routine. They set their alarm minutes earlier intentionally to remain time for phone use. To solve this user need, we plan to add a customized option in the app that will have a timer. Users can choose to have a short ‚Äòfree period‚Äô between the  alarm works and the box actually locking itself. Some other feedback is more scattering among design details. For instance, a soft cover over the box so that people feel more comfortable sleeping with a box. Also, we can add a velcro so that the box can be hung on the wall, since some users don't have a desk near their bed. Interviewees also addressed their concerns on emergency situations. In response, we plan to incorporate an emergency button that will unlock the box after being pushed for 10 sec.
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">The primary principle we came across is that of control. We want our users to feel in control of their experience - both of this product and of their relationship with their phone. We break this into two further principles: safety and customizability.
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">When it comes to safety, we noticed that one must be able to access their phone in case of an emergency. Phones often allow us a sense of security, and we wanted to make sure that we kept that while limiting their problem aspects. To do this, we added the emergency button.
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">On customizability, we also noticed that different interviewees had different morning routines, which would lead to a diverse set of personal needs regarding when the box would unlock. So, we decided to incorporate an app which would allow a user to set the box to lock and unlock during the times that made sense for them.
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">When we decided to add the App aspect, we had another brainstorming session. We decided on the things we want the app to have. One thing that we found important to add is a time setting for the lock! This is based on the feedback of someone waking up before their alarm goes off. With this setting feature, the box can lock whenever the person wants, so if they want it to lock at 4am, they can program it like that. This gives more freedom of choice for the user.
